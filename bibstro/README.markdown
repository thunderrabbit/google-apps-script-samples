# Bibstro

**Deprecated**: The sample relies on ScriptDb to store it's data, which is now 
deprecated. Please refer to the [migration guide][scriptdb_migration_guide] for 
further information.

Bibstro is a sample bibliography app for [Google Docs][docs] built upon the
[Google Apps Script][apps_script] platform. Bibstro shows how you can extend
Google Docs by adding custom menus, dialogs, and sidebars. Manipulating the
active document to add a live-updating list of sources according to the
citation format selected by the user, Bibstro enhances Google Docs by adding a
custom implementation of a feature not natively supported.

To get acquainted with Bibstro, make a copy of [this document][sample_doc] and
experiment with the custom bibliography features exposed via the “Bibstro”
menu. You can also view and edit Bibstro’s source code via the “Tools > Script
editor” menu item.
