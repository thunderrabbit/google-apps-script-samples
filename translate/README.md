# Translate

Translate is a sample script for Google Docs that allows you to translate
selected text from a set of source languages to a set of destination languages.
The resulting translation can then be inserted back into the Google Document.
This sample was originally designed as a
[quickstart](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/quickstart/docs)
for Google Docs Add-ons, and has since been updated to use
[Material design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html)
as implemented by [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/).
